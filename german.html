                    The German Shepherd is a breed of medium to large-sized working dog that originated in Germany. In the English
                    language, the breed's officially recognized name is German Shepherd Dog (GSD). The breed was officially known
                    as the Alsatian in the UK from after the First World War until 1977 when its name was changed back to German
                    Shepherd. Despite its primitive, wolf-like appearance, the German Shepherd is a relatively modern breed of 
                    dog, with their origin dating to 1899. As a herding dog, German Shepherds are working dogs developed originally 
                    for herding sheep. Since that time, however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience, 
                    German Shepherds around the world are often the preferred breed for many types of work, including disability 
                    assistance, search-and-rescue, police and military roles and acting. The German Shepherd is the second-most 
                    registered breed by the American Kennel Club and seventh-most registered breed by The Kennel Club in the United 
                    Kingdom.
