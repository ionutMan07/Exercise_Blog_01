                    The beagle is a breed of small hound that is similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound. The beagle
                    is a scent hound, developed primarily for hunting hare (beagling). Possessing a great sense of smell and 
                    superior tracking instincts, the beagle is the primary breed used as detection dogs for prohibited agricultural 
                    imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is intelligent. It is a popular pet due to its
                    size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems. The modern breed was developed in Great Britain 
                    around the 1830s from several breeds, including the Talbot Hound, the North Country Beagle, the Southern Hound, 
                    and possibly the Harrier. Beagles have been depicted in popular culture since Elizabethan times in literature 
                    and paintings, and more recently in film, television, and comic books.
