            The Rottweiler is one of the oldest of herding breeds.One author supposes that it has a history possibly dating
            back to the Roman Empire, the Rottweiler may be a descendant of ancient Roman drover dogs, dependable and rugged
            mastiff-type dogs with great intelligence and guarding instincts. During their quest to conquer Europe, the Roman legions
            traveled in large numbers across the continent. The lack of refrigeration meant soldiers brought herds of cattle for food.
            Drover dogs kept the herd together and guarded it at night. Around A.D. 74 the Roman army travelled across the Alps and
            into what is now southern Germany. For the next two centuries the Roman drover dogs were continually used in herding and
            driving cattle for trade even after the Romans were driven out of the area by the Swabians.
